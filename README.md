# Classification of Dermatological skin condition images utilizing Neural Networks


**Work developed as part of the Deep Learning course**

Several deep neural network architechtures were built: custom-built ones, ResNet, DenseNet, Multi-Input CNN.

Final Report is not very complete due to time constraints but it should be enough guidance to the code.


**TO-DO: BETTER README**
